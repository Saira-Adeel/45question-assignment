/*Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function 
should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces
 of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return
  value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album()
   that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of
    tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes
 the number of tracks on an album.*/
